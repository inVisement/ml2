Memory Less Machine Learning

## Why
Often we complain about being tracked on the web. It seems everything we do gets recorded permanently and people do not like it. For ML sake, we need data and a lot of them, so everything gets recorded. Can we approach ML differently?

How about if we have a collection of numbers and models for a user that every action only updates those numbers. These models and numbers (parameters) can easily help us to predict what the user can do in future but has no ability to know what the user has done in the past. An ML model represents the user that idealy
- can predict the user action in future accurately
- can not reveal anything about users past actions

If we can develop such ML approach, it will be a breakthrough in privacy, security, machine learning, and web experience.

### Fun Fact
You know what is special about "exponential distrubution"? It has no memory. Say, the time that takes a light bulp to break follows the "exponential distribution". No matter how long the light bulb has been working (a new one or a decade old one), the expected lifetime we have for the light bulb is the same. It has no memory how long it was working.
